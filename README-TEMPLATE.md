## Install

```
npm install module-composer
```

## Basic example

Consider the following example:

<%- await readCode('./examples/basic/compose.js') %>

`modules` is simply an object containing an entry for each module:

```js
{
    stores: { ... },
    services: { ... },
    components: { ... }
}
```

`composer` is passed `modules` and returns a `compose` function.

`compose` is then passed dependencies for a given module name and returns the "composed" module.

Each module is simply an object containing an entry for each module function:

<%- await readCode('./examples/basic/modules.js') %>

Notice the "double arrow" functions? That's syntactic sugar for "a function at returns another function".

Here's the equivalent _without_ double arrows, using `components` as an example:

```js
export default {
    components: {
        productDetails: ({ services }) => {
            return ({ product }) => { ... }
        }
    }
}
```

`compose` calls the first arrow function with the specified dependencies for each entry in the module and returns the second arrow function.

This is analogous to calling a class constructor with dependencies and returning the resulting instance. However rather than using a class to encapsulate dependency state, closures (stateful functions) are used instead.

## File system structure

The module hierarchy can be easily represented by the file system:

```js
modules/
    index.js
    stores/
        index.js
        addToCart.js        
    services/
        index.js
        orderProduct.js        
    components/
        index.js
        productDetails.js        
```

`index.js` files can be used as "barrel" files to rollup each file in a directory:

<%- await readCode('./examples/basic/modules/index.js') %>

<%- await readCode('./examples/basic/modules/components/index.js') %>

This pattern opens the possibility of autogenerating `index.js` files.

`module-indexgen` is a package designed to do just that: https://github.com/mattriley/node-module-indexgen

## Generating Mermaid diagrams

[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io) is a tool for creating diagrams and visualizations using text and code. Since early 2022, GitHub can render diagrams directly from Mermaid syntax in markdown files. See [Include diagrams in your Markdown files with Mermaid](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) for more information.

This diagram is generated from the basic example above:

<%- await moduleGraph('./examples/basic/compose.js') %>

module-composer produces a module named `composition` which can be used to generate Mermaid syntax.

A consumer might generate Mermaid syntax like so:

```js
const { composition } = compose();
const graph = composition.mermaid();
```

## Advanced example: Agile Avatars

> Great looking avatars for your agile board and experiment in FRAMEWORK-LESS, vanilla JavaScript.<br/>
https://agileavatars.com â€¢ https://github.com/mattriley/agileavatars

Module composition:

<%- await readCode(['../agileavatars', './src/compose.js']) %>

Generated Mermaid digram:

<%- await moduleGraph('../agileavatars/src/compose.js') %>
